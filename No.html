    <h1>Bad Mood may not always be the most cheerful or optimistic friend, but they are undoubtedly a loyal and supportive one. They may not always have a sunny disposition, but their honesty and authenticity make them a true gem. When you're feeling down, Bad Mood is the friend who won't sugarcoat things or try to force a smile. Instead, they'll listen without judgment and offer a shoulder to lean on. They understand that sometimes all you need is someone to commiserate with, and they're more than happy to oblige. In short, Bad Mood may not always be the life of the party, but they're the friend who will always have your back, no matter what.<br><center><span style='font-size:100px;'>&#128512;</span></center></h1>
